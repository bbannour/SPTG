**SPTG** is a model-based test generation tool that automatically produces **conformance deterministic test cases** from system models combining both **data** and **timing constraints**. As shown in **Figure 1**, SPTG takes an **automaton model** and a **test purpose**, i.e., a path of the model, and generates the corresponding **test case automaton** with **verdict states** PASS, FAIL, INC (for inconclusive).


It relies on **path-guided symbolic execution**, which explores the input path and builds **symbolic constraints** over inputs and timing.
SPTG embeds the **SMT-solver Z3**, which is used to check the **satisfiability of path conditions** along the main test purpose path and its **immediate divergent paths**, as well as to check determinism.
Infeasible branches, inconsistent with the test purpose, are pruned early during symbolic exploration, avoiding dead paths that correspond to excluded behaviors.

  </div>


**Figure 2** illustrates the execution phase, where the generated test case interacts with the **System Under Test (SUT)**. During execution, **Z3** is used to solve the **stimulation conditions (guards)**, determining the inputs and timings to apply. Test case transitions are controlled by a clock cl, which satisfies cl < TM, where TM is the maximal waiting time before either applying a stimulation or observing an output. Quiescence, i.e., the obersvation of absence of output, is detected when cl >= TM, indicating that the system remains silent. This timing mechanism, combined with quiescence detection, ensures the test case is implementable in a real-time setting. Additionally, **Z3** is used to check that the **observed outputs** and their **timings** satisfy the corresponding observation conditions, after which verdicts are assigned.

### Applications

- **Model-Based Testing (MBT)** of systems exhibiting temporal and data-related behaviors.
- **Offline generation** of efficient and deterministic test cases from formal models.  
- **Teaching and demonstration** of symbolic execution and model-based test generation principles.

### References

**SPTG** implements the **symbolic path-guided test generation approach**, developed in: üëâ [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2025.103285](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2025.103285) *(Open Access)*.

As an extension of the symbolic execution platform Diversity ([https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-formal-modeling-project](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-formal-modeling-project)), which is distributed under the Eclipse Formal Modeling Project, SPTG can leverage its coverage analyses for **test purpose selection**, providing an integrated environment for offline timed symbolic testing.

## Quick start with SPTG
---

**SPTG directory Structure**:

- `bin/`: This directory contains the SPTG tool binary `sptg.exe`. It also includes the PlantUML JAR which enable visualization and export of generated test cases in SVG format.

- `examples/`: This directory contains all examples. It includes: a subdirectory for each example; and a script `run-all.sh` which executes all preconfigured test case generation tasks across all examples.  
Each example subdirectory includes:
  - The reference model.
  - A local script (`run-sptg.sh`, `run-sptg-h2.sh`, or `run-sptg-h5.sh`) that calls SPTG for a preconfigured test case generation task.  
  The `run-all.sh` script sequentially executes all local scripts.

- `tutorials/`: This directory contains three tutorials and their associated files: a tutorial on model specification, a tutorial on test case generation, and a tutorial on test purpose selection. The test purpose selection feature is inherited from the symbolic execution platform Diversity, which SPTG extends.

- `src/`: Contains the C++ source code of SPTG.

- `third-party/`: Directory for third-party libraries.

- `packages/`: Directory for dependencies.

- `Release/`: Contains release artifacts.

- `LICENSE`: The artifact license (same license as the Diversity symbolic execution platform).

- `examples-outputs.zip`: Compressed folder containing outputs generated by executing all examples from our experiments.

- `README_files`: Readme files for the Markdown required images.

- `README`: This file.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Install dependencies (Graphviz, ...)** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The required dependencies are provided in the `packages` directory. 

```bash
cd /path/to/SPTG/packages
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

---
### Start with dummy example
---

```sh
cd /path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/
./run-sptg-h2.sh
```


This script instructs **SPTG** to generate a **test case** with the following specifications:

- **Reference model:**  
  `/path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/example02_dummy.xlia`

- **Test purpose:** Defined as the **sequence of transitions**: `tr1; tr2`

- **Action:**  Generate a **test case** corresponding to the given reference model and test purpose.


<div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"></div>

> **Note:**  
> The input reference model automaton is encoded in the **XLIA language** (file `.xlia`), the input language of the symbolic execution platform **Diversity**, which **SPTG** extends. See tutorial on model specification [here](#sptg-tutorials) for more details.

<div style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"></div>

**SPTG** generates the resulting **test case automaton** in the following formats:


- **Graphical format: PlantUML**  
  **File** `/path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/output_h2/testcase.puml`  
  *Comment:* This file provides a visual representation of the test case automaton, which can be rendered using PlantUML.

- **JSON format with SMT-LIB guards**  
  **File** `/path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/output_h2/testcase_smt.json`  
  *Comment:* This JSON file encodes the test case automaton, including guards in SMT-LIB format, suitable for automated execution againt system under test (SUT) using an SMT-solver (e.g. Z3).

- **Specification language: XLIA**  
  The same language used to express the reference model.  
  **File** `/path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/output_h2/testcase.xlia`  
  *Comment:* This file can be explored using the symbolic execution platform Diversity.

> **Note:** The script also generates the graphical **PlantUML** file for the reference automaton:  
> **File** `/path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/output_h2/example02_dummy.puml`  
> *Comment:* This file provides a visual representation of the reference automaton. 

> **Note:** You can visualize `.puml` files using [PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases) or the online tool [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/). You can convert a file `.puml` to a file `.svg` (see the [PlantUML Conversion Guide](#plantuml-puml-to-svg-conversion-guide)).

> **Note:** If the PlantUML JAR is located in `/path/to/SPTG/bin` and ‚ö†Ô∏è Graphviz is installed ‚ö†Ô∏è, the script automatically produces:  
> **File** `/path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/output_h2/example02_dummy.svg`  
> **File** `/path/to/SPTG/examples/example02_dummy/output_h2/testcase.svg`

The table below summarizes the inputs and outputs for generating the **test case** with SPTG. The figures shown are **visual representations** obtained by converting the corresponding **PlantUML** files into **SVG** format.

### Run all examples
---
```sh
cd /path/to/SPTG/examples/
./run-all.sh
```
> **Note:** The results of running all examples are provided in the file `/path/to/SPTG/examples-outputs.zip`.
---
### Compilation instructions
---
The compilation procedure is detailed below for recent linux.

To compile SPTG, navigate to the `Release` directory:
```bash
cd Release/
```
Then build the project:
```bash
make all -j4
```
During compilation, the process automatically overwrites the existing `sptg.exe` in the `bin` directory using:
```bash
cp -f sptg.exe ../bin/sptg.exe
```
If you wish to preserve the existing executable, rename it before compilation for instance as follows:
```bash
mv ../bin/sptg.exe ../bin/sptg_old.exe
```

> **Note:** The compilation and testing of SPTG have been performed on the virtual machine published at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17171929](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17171929).  
> The VM runs on **Ubuntu 25.04**, and the compilation was executed within this environment.  
> The VM was executed with **VirtualBox Version 7.1.12 r169651 (Qt 6.5.3)** [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

> **Note:** The `-j4` option in the `make` command allows up to 4 compilation jobs to run in parallel, speeding up the build process by using multiple CPU cores.

### Prerequisites

1. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Required to execute PlantUML.  
2. **PlantUML JAR File:** The standalone PlantUML application.  
3. **Graphviz:** Used internally by PlantUML for layout and rendering. 
> **Note:** If ‚ö†Ô∏èGraphviz is installed ‚ö†Ô∏è, it will be available in your system path.

### Download PlantUML

Get the latest stable release of `plantuml.jar` from:  
üëâ [https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases)

Ensure both `java` and `dot`(Graphviz) commands are available:

```bash
java -version
dot -V
```

### Conversion Command

Navigate to the folder containing both `plantuml.jar` and your `.puml` file.

Use the `-tsvg` flag to generate an SVG image:

| **Command** | **Action** |
|--------------|------------|
| `java -jar plantuml.jar -tsvg yourfile.puml` | Converts the input file (`.puml`) to an SVG output (`.svg`). |
